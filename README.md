The binary tree that we created is comprised of 8 initial methods and 5 supplemental methods that were distributed between the four group memebers. A binary tree is a data structure that is linked to a successor root number. In our case we used nodes to point to other nodes that contained other numners,that are displayed on the binary tree that is output. The intial methods we used were initialize, search, insert, printinorder, printpreorder, printpostorder, btsize, and treeheight.
